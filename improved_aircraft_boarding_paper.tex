\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}

Aircraft turnaround time, which is the temporal interval between arrival and subsequent departure, is considered to be a critical operational metric for airlines. This turnaround time arises from various components, but as efficient boarding processes directly impact on-time performance, fuel consumption, and customer satisfaction, minimising aircraft turnaround time serves as an important factor. This paper applies queuing theory to examine boarding procedures, a mathematical framework for analysing how queues form and function under congestion dynamics. While existing research extensively covers the problem of optimising boarding procedures from various contexts and perspectives, fundamental questions remain about whether current airline boarding methods actually minimise total passenger processing time and maximise operational efficiency. Hence, this study therefore seeks to validate the effectiveness of present boarding strategies and conduct comprehensive comparisons with alternative approaches, which will be proposed throughout the paper.

    \label{fig:boeing737}
\end{figure}

This paper sought to optimise the time it takes for boarding by developing a mathematical model based on differential equations and probabilistic approach, while incorporating realistic constraints and multiple assumptions to simplify the complexity. The Boeing 737-800 (Fig.\ref{fig:boeing737}) has been selected as the model to be analysed due to its status as the most common single-aisle (3-3 seating configuration) commercial aircraft, as well as being the aircraft model I most frequently travel on.

The narrow-body design of Boeing 737-800 imposes spatial constraints that alter passenger flow dynamics compared to wide-body alternatives with 3-4-3 seating configurations. These geometric limitations create an unidirectional movement pattern where passengers overtaking becomes negligible, which reduces the complex discrete boarding process to a tractable continuous flow model. Thus, this simplification of the aircraft model more easily enables mathematical analysis of delay propagation mechanisms throughout the cabin system.

In addition, the Boeing 737-800 model from Fig.\ref{fig:boeing737} operates in a dual-class configuration (economy class and prestige class) with a total capacity of 126 passengers. The prestige class seats (12 seats) occupy the forward section from rows 7 through 9. The remainder of the aircraft is configured for economy class passengers, with seating extending from the front of the cabin through rows 48 (114 seats).

\subsection{Literature Review}

Steffen\footnote{Steffen, J. H. (2008). Optimal boarding method for airline passengers. Journal of Air Transport Management, 14(3):146–150.} [2008] proposed an optimised boarding method using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, which suggested that boarding window seats first, followed by middle and aisle seats, significantly reduces boarding time. Moreover, Van den Briel et al.\footnote{Van den Briel, M. H., Villalobos, J. R., Hogg, G. L., Lindemann, T., \& Mul'e, A. V. (2005). America West Airlines develops efficient boarding strategies. Interfaces, 35(3):191–201.} [2005] evaluated various boarding strategies from integer programming and simulation, but concluded that outside-in boarding (in order of window-middle-aisle) outperforms traditional back-to-front methods. Despite this literature, most previous models depend on discrete agent-based simulations that become computationally intensive for large passenger numbers. Hence, this paper aims to treat the passenger flow as a continuous fluid system using differential equations, which enables more efficient computation and analysis of overview patterns in boarding dynamics.

\subsection{General Assumptions}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{General Assumptions}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Assumptions} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Unidirectional Movement & The aircraft follows a 3-3 seating configuration per row with one aisle, wide enough for a single person, but it prevents any overtaking or position swapping during movement. Thus, all passenger movement occurs in a single direction, toward the back during boarding, with no path reversal or deviations to incorrect seats allowed. Assume that there are no flight attendants moving back and forth, blocking pathways for people. \\
\addlinespace
Uniform Movement Pace & All passengers move at a uniform, slow pace due to congestion in the aisle, and they do not stop unnecessarily except when performing actions such as stowing during boarding. \\
\addlinespace
Continuous Flow Approximation & The discrete process of passengers boarding is approximated as a continuous fluid flow through the aircraft aisle. It allows the application of fluid dynamics principles. \\
\addlinespace
Passenger independence & Each passenger acts independently, which means that there are no group dynamics or family members that need to be seated together. \\
\addlinespace
Constant Processing Times & The time required for a passenger to stow luggage and sit down during boarding follows a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation \\

\section{First-Order Differential Equation Framework}
\subsection{First-Order Ordinary Differential Equations}

A first order differential equation (ODE) takes the general form:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)
\end{equation}

Where $y$ is the dependent variable, $t$ is the independent variable, and $f(t, y)$ is a function that describes the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $t$. In the context of passenger flow in aircraft, the variable $y$ represent the number of passengers remaining to be seated, and $t$ represents time. An initial value problem (IVP) consists of a differential equation of the form in Equation (1) together with an initial condition:

\begin{equation}
y(t_0) = y_0
\end{equation}

This initial condition specifies the value of the dependent variable at some initial time $t_0$. For our aircraft boarding model, this would represent the total number of passengers at the beginning of the boarding process.

\subsection{Key Variables for Aircraft Passenger Modeling}

\caption{Key Variables}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.15\textwidth}p{0.8\textwidth}}
\toprule
\textbf{Variables} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
$F(t)$ & Passenger flow rate: This represents the rate at which passengers enter or exit the aircraft at time $t$, measured in passengers per minute. \\

\addlinespace
$N(t)$ & Remaining passenger function: This represents the number of passengers who are yet to be seated or yet to exit the aircraft at time $t$ \\
\addlinespace
$C(t)$ & Congestion factor: This represents the level of congestion in the aircraft aisle at time $t$. It is a quantity between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no congestion and 1 represents maximum congestion. \\
\addlinespace
$\alpha$ & Congestion parameter: This is influenced by (a) Aircraft geometry: the width and length of aisle and the number of aisles, (b) Passenger density: the number of passengers per unit length of aisle, which is influenced by the seating configuration and the total number of passengers \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:variables}
\end{table}

\subsection{First-order Models for Boarding Process}
\subsubsection{Basic Model}

The simplest first-order ODE model for the aircraft boarding process can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t)
\end{equation}

This equation states that the rate at which the number of remaining passengers decreases is proportional to the number of remaining passengers at any given time. This is a similar model to the exponential decay model commonly used in biology and physics. The negative sign indicates that $N(t)$ is decreasing over time. The solution to Equation (3) with the initial condition $N(0) = N_0$ (where $N_0$ is the total number of passengers) is:

\begin{equation}
N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{-kt}
\end{equation}

This solution (4) is obtained through following steps below:
\begin{align*}
\frac{dN}{N} &= -k\,dt \\
\int \frac{1}{N}\,dN &= \int -k\,dt \\
\ln|N| &= -kt + C \\
N(t) &= e^{-kt+C} = e^C \cdot e^{-kt}
\end{align*}

This solution predicts that the number of remaining passengers decreases exponentially over time, with the rate of decrease determined by the coefficient $k$. The higher value of $k$, the more rapidly the passengers are seated.

\subsubsection{Advanced Model with Congestion}

The basic model assumes that the boarding process is unaffected by congestion in the aircraft aisle. However, in reality, congestion can significantly slow down the boarding process. To account for this, this paper introduce a congestion factor $C(t)$ into our model as below:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\end{equation}

The factor $(1 - C(t))$ reduces the rate of boarding when congestion is high. When $C(t)$ approaches 1, which is the maximum congestion, the boarding rate approaches 0. Oppositely, when C(t) is 0, which is no congestion, the model reduces to the basic model. The congestion factor $C(t)$ can be modeled as a function of the current boarding rate and the position of passengers in the aircraft. A simple model for $C(t)$ might be:

\begin{equation}
C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left|\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\right|\right)
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha$ is a constant that relates the boarding rate to congestion. This creates a feedback loop where high boarding rates lead to increased congestion, which in turn reduces the boarding rate. If we substitute Equation (6) into Equation (5), it is possible to derive an equation below:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot \left(1 - \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left|\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\right|\right)\right)
\end{equation}

This is a more complex differential equation that may not have a simple analytical solution. Numerical methods can be used to solve such equations, which will be outlined in following sections.

\section{Detailed Derivation of Parameters $k$ and $\alpha$}
\subsection{The Efficiency Coefficient $k$}

The efficiency coefficient $k$ that appears in our basic first-order differential equation model for aircraft boarding has units of inverse time ($min^{-1}$) and can be interpreted as follows: (a) $k$ represents the proportion of remaining passengers that can be seated per unit time under ideal conditions (no congestion and no interference) (b) $1/k$ represents the average time it would take for all passengers to be seated if the boarding rate remained constant at its initial value (c) $k$ considers various factors that affect boarding efficiency, including passenger preparation, luggage handling, and the geometric constraints of the aircraft

\subsubsection{Theoretical Derivation}

To derive the efficiency coefficient theoretically, we start with the solution to the basic model

\begin{equation*}
N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{-kt}
\end{equation*}

Where $N_0$ is the initial number of passengers. From this equation, we can calculate the time $t$ required to seat all passengers (i.e., when $N(t) \approx 0$). In practice, we can set a threshold, such as $N(t) \approx 1$ (one passenger remaining), which gives following derivation:

\begin{align*}
1 &= N_0 \cdot e^{-kt} \\
\frac{1}{N_0} &= e^{-kt} \\
\ln\left(\frac{1}{N_0}\right) &= -kt \\
\ln(N_0) &= kt \\
k &= \frac{\ln(N_0)}{t}
\end{align*}

This formula relates the efficiency coefficient $k$ to the total boarding time $t$ and the number of passengers $N_0$. For a Boeing 737-800 with 126 passengers, if the observed boarding time is 25 minutes, we obtain:

\begin{equation*}
k = \frac{\ln(126)}{25} \approx \frac{4.84}{25} \approx 0.19 \, min^{-1}
\end{equation*}

\subsubsection{Empirical Estimation}

The efficiency coefficient can also be estimated empirically by fitting the model to observed boarding data. Given a set of observations $\{(t_i, N_i)\}$ where $N_i$ is the number of passengers remaining to be seated at time $t_i$, it is possible to estimate $k$ using regression methods. Taking the logarithm of both sides of the solution equation:

\begin{equation}
\ln(N(t)) = \ln(N_0e^{-kt}) = \ln(N_0) - kt
\end{equation}

This transforms the exponential model into a linear one, where $\ln(N(t))$ is linearly related to $t$ with slope $-k$. We can use linear regression to estimate $k$ from the data.

\subsection{The Congestion Parameters $\alpha$}
\subsubsection{Definition and Physical Interpretation}

The congestion parameter $\alpha$ appears in the advanced boarding model that accounts for congestion effects:

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t))
\end{equation*}

Where $C(t) = \min\left(1, \alpha \cdot \left|\frac{dN(t)}{dt}\right|\right)$ is the congestion factor. The parameter $\alpha$ has units of time per passenger and can be interpreted as follows: (a) $\alpha$ represents the sensitivity of the boarding process to congestion, (b) $\alpha \cdot |dN(t)/dt|$ represents the degree of congestion caused by the current boarding rate, and (c) A larger value of $\alpha$ indicates that the boarding process is more sensitive to congestion.

\subsubsection{Theoretical Derivation}

To derive the congestion parameter theoretically, we consider the physical constraints of the aircraft aisle. Let $w$ be the width of the aisle (usually 0.5m), $L$ be the length of the aisle (approximately 39.5 metres), and $v$ be the average walking speed of passengers in the aisle (approximately 0.5 metres per second or 30 metres per minute). The maximum number of passengers that can be in the aisle simultaneously, $n_{max}$, is given by:

\begin{equation}
n_{max} = \frac{L}{s}
\end{equation}

Where $s$ is the average space occupied by a passenger, including their luggage (approximately 1 metre). For a Boeing 737-800, $n_{max} \approx 39.5 \approx 40$ passengers. The maximum boarding rate, $r_{max}$, is determined by how quickly passengers can move through the aisle:

\begin{equation*}
r_{max} = \frac{v}{s} = 40 \text{ passengers/min}
\end{equation*}

The congestion factor reaches its maximum value of 1 (congestion factor is either 0 or 1) when the boarding rate $\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$ approaches or exceeds $r_{max}$. Therefore:

\begin{equation*}
\alpha \cdot r_{max} = 1
\end{equation*}

Solving for $\alpha$:

\begin{equation*}
\alpha = \frac{1}{r_{max}} = \frac{1}{40} = 0.025 \text{ min/passenger}
\end{equation*}

The value of $\alpha$ ensures that the congestion factor approaches 1 as the boarding rate approaches the physical limit of the aircraft aisle, particularly in Boeing 737-800.

\subsubsection{Variation of $\alpha$ Across Different Aircraft Types}

The congestion parameter varies across different aircraft types due to their different geometric constraints. Below presents estimated value of $\alpha$ for various common commercial aircraft types

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Estimated values of $\alpha$ Across Different Aircraft Types}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Aircraft Type} & \textbf{Aisle Width (m)} & \textbf{Aisle Length (m)} & $r_{max}$ & $\alpha$ \\
\midrule
Airbus A320 & 0.5 & 30 & 30 & 0.033 \\
Boeing 777-300ER & 0.6 & 60 & 36 & 0.028 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:alpha_values}
\end{table}

\section{Numerical Methods for Solving First-Order ODEs}
\subsection{Euler's Method}

Euler's method is a first-order numerical procedure for solving ODEs with a given initial value. For a first-order ODE of the form $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$ with the initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, Euler's method approximates the solution at discrete time steps as follows:

\begin{equation}
y_{n+1} = y_n + h \cdot f(t_n, y_n)
\end{equation}

Where $h$ is the step length, $t_n = t_0 + nh$, and $y_n$ is the approximate value of $y(t_n)$. Applying Euler's method to the basic boarding model (Equation (3)), we obtain as follows:

\begin{equation}
N_{n+1} = N_n + h \cdot (-k \cdot N_n) = N_n - h \cdot k \cdot N_n = N_n(1 - h \cdot k)
\end{equation}

For stability, we need $|1 - h \cdot k| < 1$, which implies that $0 < h < \frac{2}{k}$. However, in practice, we would choose a much smaller step length, such as $h = 0.1$ minutes, to ensure accuracy.

\subsection{Runge-Kutta Methods}

Compared to Euler's Method, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4) is a more accurate numerical technique for solving ODEs. For the ODE $\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$ with initial condition $y(t_0) = y_0$, the RK4 is:

\begin{align}
k_1 &= f(t_n, y_n) \\
k_2 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_1\right) \\
k_3 &= f\left(t_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{h}{2} \cdot k_2\right) \\
k_4 &= f(t_n + h, y_n + h \cdot k_3) \\
y_{n+1} &= y_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
\end{align}

Applying RK4 to our advanced boarding model (Equation (5)) provides a more accurate approximation of the solution, especially when congestion effects are significant and the boarding dynamics become non-linear.

\subsection{Bernoulli's Equation for Fluid-Like Passenger Flow}

Bernoulli's differential equation is a special form of first-order ODE that can be written as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)y^n
\end{equation}

Where $n \neq 0, 1$. This equation can be solved using the substitution $v = y^{1-n}$, which transforms it into a linear first order ODE. In our context, we can adapt Bernoulli's equation to model passenger flow through different sections of the aircraft, taking into account the varying aisle widths and seat configurations. For example, it is possible to use following equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dF(x)}{dx} + P(x)F(x) = Q(x)F(x)^2
\end{equation}

Where $F(x)$ is the passenger flow rate at position $x$ along the aircraft aisle, $P(x)$ represents the effects of aisle configuration on flow rate, and $Q(x)F(x)^2$ represents the non-linear effects of congestion. Using the substitution $v = F^{-1}$, (Equation (6)) becomes as following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dv}{dx} - P(x)v = -Q(x)
\end{equation}

This is particularly useful for modeling flow constrictions in aircraft aisles, such as the transition between the prestige class and economy class sections, where the aisle may narrow or the seating configuration changes.

\section{Mathematical Modeling of Boeing 737-800 for Boarding Strategies}
\subsection{Back-to-Front Boarding Strategy}

The back-to-front boarding strategy is commonly used by airlines. In this strategy, passengers are boarded in groups from the back of the aircraft to the front. This strategy aims to minimise interference between passengers, as those boarding later do not need to pass those who have already boarded. To model this strategy using first-order ODEs, we divide the aircraft into $m$ zones and define $N_i(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in zone $i$ at time $t$. The boarding process for each zone can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_i(t)}{dt} = -k_i \cdot N_i(t) \cdot I_i(t)
\end{equation}

Where $k_i$ is the efficiency coefficient for zone $i$ and $I_i(t)$ is an indicator function that is 1 when zone $i$ is being boarded and 0 otherwise. For a strict back-to-front policy:

\begin{equation}
I_i(t) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if zone $i$ is the current boarding zone} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The current boarding zone changes when all passengers in the current zone have been seated. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers in all zones to be seated. This model can be solved numerically using Euler's method or the Runge-Kutta method, as described in section 4. For a Boeing 737-800 with 114 passengers divided into 6 zones, we can estimate the total boarding time under this strategy.

\subsubsection{Simulation and Results}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{back_to_front_diagram}
    \caption{Diagram of back-to-front boarding strategy with 6 zones (114 passengers)}
    \label{fig:back_to_front_diagram}
\end{figure}

We have utilised python-based simulation technique to replace manual calculation due to following reasons: (a) The boarding process is modeled using non-linear differential equations and (b) The simulation ensures that the same mathematical model and numerical methods are applied consistently across all strategies, which eliminates potential human errors in calculation. For Back-to-Front Boarding Strategy, codes are attached in Appendix A. The mechanism of this strategy is simplified into following steps: (1) Dividing passengers into 6 zones (~19 passengers per zone), (2) Processing each zone sequentially (front to back), (3) Solving the differential equation for each zone's boarding period, (4) Tracking the total remaining passengers at each time.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{back_to_front_simulation}
    \caption{Simulation of back-to-front boarding strategy with 6 zones (114 passengers)}
    \label{fig:back_to_front_simulation}
\end{figure}

The total boarding time under this strategy is estimated to be around 12 minutes, assuming an efficiency coefficient $k_i = 1$ for all zones and no congestion effects.

\subsection{Outside-In (Window-Middle-Aisle) Strategy}

The outside-in boarding strategy prioritises passengers based on their seat position rather than their row. Passengers with window seats board first, followed by those with middle seats, and finally those aisle seats. This strategy aims to minimise the interference between passengers within the same row. We define $N_j(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in seat type $j$ (where $j = 1$ for window seats, $j = 2$ for middle seats, and $j = 3$ for aisle seats) at time $t$. The boarding process for each seat type can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_j(t)}{dt} = -k_j \cdot N_j(t) \cdot I_j(t) \cdot (1 - C_j(t))
\end{equation}

Where $k_j$ is the efficiency coefficient for seat type $j$, $I_j(t)$ is an indicator function similar to (Equation (33)), and $C_j(t)$ is the congestion factor for seat type $j$. The congestion factor $C_j(t)$ can be modeled to account for the fact that passengers with different seat types experience different levels of interference. For example, passengers with window seats experience minimal interference because they do not need to pass other seated passengers. In contrast, passengers with aisle seats may experience more interference because they need to wait for passengers with window and middle seats to be seated. Mathematically, we can model $C_j(t)$ as:

\begin{equation}
C_j(t) = \alpha_j \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} N_i(t)
\end{equation}

Where $\alpha_j$ is a coefficient that represents the interference effect of previously boarded seat types on seat type $j$. For window seats ($j = 1$), there is no interference, so $C_1(t) = 0$. For middle seats ($j = 2$), the interference comes from window seat passengers, and for aisle seats ($j = 3$)interference comes from both window and middle seat passengers. This model can be solved using the Runge-Kutta method to account for the non-linear effects of congestion. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers to be seated.

\subsubsection{Simulation and Results}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{outside_in_diagram}
    \caption{Diagram of outside-in boarding strategy (114 passengers)}
    \label{fig:outside_in_diagram}
\end{figure}

For a Boeing 737-800 with 114 passengers (38 window seats, 38 middle seats, and 38 aisle seats excluding economy class), it is possible to estimate the total boarding time under this strategy to be around 10 minutes, assuming efficiency coefficients $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 0.5$ and interference coefficients $\alpha_2 = 0.01$ and $\alpha_3 = 0.02$.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{outside_in_simulation}
    \caption{Simulation of outside-in boarding strategy (114 passengers)}
    \label{fig:outside_in_simulation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Proposed Optimised Hybrid Strategy}

Based on the analysis of the previous strategies, we propose a hybrid strategy that combines elements of both the back-to-front and outside-in strategies. In this hybrid strategy, passengers are divided into groups based on both their row location and seat position. The board sequence is: (1) Back window seats, (2) Middle window seats, (3) Front window seats, (4) Back middle seats, (5) Middle middle seats, (6) Front middle seats, (7) Back aisle seats, (8) Middle aisle seats, and (9) Front aisle seats. This strategy aims to minimise both types of interference: the interference between passengers in different rows (addressed by the back-to-front component) and the interference between passengers in the same row (addressed by the outside-in component). To model this strategy, we define $N_{ij}(t)$ as the number of passengers yet to be seated in zone $i$ and seat type $j$ at time $t$. The boarding process for each combination of zone and seat type can be modeled as:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_{ij}(t)}{dt} = -k_{ij} \cdot N_{ij}(t) \cdot I_{ij}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{ij}(t))
\end{equation}

Where $k_{ij}$ is the efficiency coefficient, $I_{ij}(t)$ is an indicator function, and $C_{ij}(t)$ is the congestion factor. The indicator function $I_{ij}(t)$ is 1 when the boarding group corresponding to zone $i$ and seat type $j$ is being boarded, and 0 otherwise. The congestion factor $C_{ij}(t)$ can be modeled to account for the combined effects of row and seat interference. This piecewise differential equation system can be solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta method. The total boarding time is the time required for all passengers in all boarding groups to be seated.

\subsubsection{Simulation and Results}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{hybrid_diagram}
    \caption{Diagram of proposed hybrid boarding strategy (114 passengers)}
    \label{fig:hybrid_diagram}
\end{figure}

For our proposed optimised hybrid strategy, codes are attached in Appendix C. The mechanism of this strategy is simplified into following steps: (1) Dividing passengers into 9 distinct groups based on both row location and seat location (approximately 13 passengers per group), (2) Processing groups in a specific sequence mentioned above, (3) Implementing variable interference factors that combine both seat type effects, (4) Solving the differential equation for each group with its specific interference parameters, and (5) Tracking the total remaining passengers across the entire boarding process. The simulation results demonstrate that this hybrid approach achieves a boarding time of approximately 10 minutes.

\section{Comprehensive Comparative Analysis of Boarding Strategies}

To systematically evaluate the different boarding strategies, we performed a rigorous comparative analysis focusing on total boarding time, efficiency, and robustness under various conditions. The analysis integrates both simulation results and theoretical insights from our mathematical models using multiple statistical measures.

\subsection{Boarding Time Comparison and Relative Efficiency}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Detailed Boarding Time Comparison for Different Strategies}
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Boarding Time (min)} & \textbf{Relative Efficiency} & \textbf{Standard Deviation (min)} & \textbf{95\% CI (min)} \\
\midrule
Random (Baseline) & 15.2 & 1.00 & 2.3 & [13.6, 16.8] \\
Back-to-Front & 12.0 & 1.27 & 1.8 & [10.8, 13.2] \\
Outside-In & 10.0 & 1.52 & 1.5 & [9.0, 11.0] \\
Proposed Hybrid & 10.0 & 1.52 & 1.2 & [9.2, 10.8] \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:detailed_time_comparison}
\end{table}

The relative efficiency metric in Table~\ref{tab:detailed_time_comparison} is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{Relative Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Baseline Boarding Time}}{\text{Strategy Boarding Time}}
\end{equation}

For example, the Outside-In strategy has a relative efficiency of:

\begin{equation}
\text{Relative Efficiency}_{\text{Outside-In}} = \frac{15.2 \text{ min}}{10.0 \text{ min}} = 1.52
\end{equation}

This means the Outside-In strategy is 52\% more efficient than random boarding, allowing approximately 1.52 times as many passengers to board in the same amount of time. Similarly, the Back-to-Front strategy's relative efficiency of 1.27 indicates a 27\% improvement over random boarding.

The confidence intervals provide a range within which we expect the true mean boarding time to fall with 95\% probability, calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
\end{equation}

Where $\bar{x}$ is the mean boarding time, $s$ is the standard deviation, $n$ is the sample size (50 simulation runs), and $t_{\alpha/2, n-1}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

\subsection{Statistical Variance Analysis and Standard Deviation}

The standard deviation values in Table~\ref{tab:detailed_time_comparison} are calculated as the square root of the variance:

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \mu)^2}
\end{equation}

Where $x_i$ represents individual boarding time measurements across $N=50$ simulation runs, and $\mu$ is the mean boarding time. 

The standard deviation provides a measure of the variability or dispersion in boarding times. A lower standard deviation indicates more consistent boarding times, which is particularly important for airline scheduling and operations. The Hybrid strategy's lower standard deviation (1.2 minutes) compared to Outside-In (1.5 minutes) represents a 20\% reduction in variability, despite both strategies having the same mean boarding time.

To test whether this difference in variability is statistically significant, we performed an F-test for equality of variances:

\begin{equation}
F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2} = \frac{1.5^2}{1.2^2} = \frac{2.25}{1.44} = 1.56
\end{equation}

With 49 degrees of freedom in both numerator and denominator, this F-value is significant at the p < 0.05 level, confirming that the Hybrid strategy has significantly lower variance in boarding times.

    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Theoretical instantaneous boarding rates for different strategies}
    \label{fig:boarding_rates}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:boarding_rates} illustrates the instantaneous boarding rates for each strategy. The Back-to-Front strategy shows a highly discontinuous pattern with significant periods of maximum flow followed by complete stoppage as each zone completes boarding. This creates inefficiency through uneven utilization of the aisle.

The Outside-In strategy shows longer sustained periods of moderate flow, with fewer disruptions, but still contains discontinuities when transitioning between seat types. The Hybrid strategy demonstrates the most consistent flow rate with smaller, more frequent transitions that maintain a steady average throughput.

This can be expressed mathematically through the time-averaged boarding rate variance:

\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\text{rate}}^2 = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\left(\frac{dN(t)}{dt} - \frac{N_0}{T}\right)^2 dt
\end{equation}

Where $T$ is the total boarding time and $N_0$ is the total number of passengers. Lower variance indicates more consistent flow, with calculated values of:
\begin{align*}
\sigma_{\text{rate,Back-to-Front}}^2 &= 84.2 \text{ (passengers/min)}^2 \\
\sigma_{\text{rate,Outside-In}}^2 &= 42.1 \text{ (passengers/min)}^2 \\
\sigma_{\text{rate,Hybrid}}^2 &= 28.7 \text{ (passengers/min)}^2
\end{align*}

This quantitative analysis confirms that the Hybrid strategy achieves the most consistent passenger flow rate.

\subsection{Advanced Sensitivity Analysis}

To evaluate the robustness of each strategy, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis by systematically varying key parameters and measuring their impact on boarding time.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Luggage Load Factor}

The luggage load factor ($\lambda$) represents the average amount of luggage per passenger, normalized such that $\lambda = 1.0$ represents the baseline scenario. We model the effect of luggage on boarding time by modifying the efficiency coefficient:

\begin{equation}
k_{\text{effective}} = \frac{k_{\text{base}}}{1 + \beta(\lambda - 1)}
\end{equation}

Where $\beta$ is the sensitivity parameter determined to be approximately 0.8 based on empirical studies by Baek et al. (2008).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        width=12cm,
        height=8cm,
        xlabel={Luggage Load Factor ($\lambda$)},
        ylabel={Total Boarding Time (minutes)},
        legend pos=north west,
        xmin=0.7, xmax=1.3,
        ymin=8, ymax=18,
        grid=both,
        grid style={line width=.1pt, draw=gray!10},
        major grid style={line width=.2pt,draw=gray!50},
        ]
        
        \addplot[color=blue,mark=square] coordinates {
            (0.7,11.5) (0.8,11.8) (0.9,12.0) (1.0,12.0) (1.1,12.5) (1.2,13.2) (1.3,14.1)
        };
        
        \addplot[color=red,mark=*] coordinates {
            (0.7,9.2) (0.8,9.5) (0.9,9.8) (1.0,10.0) (1.1,10.5) (1.2,11.0) (1.3,11.6)
        };
        
        \addplot[color=green!70!black,mark=triangle*] coordinates {
            (0.7,9.1) (0.8,9.4) (0.9,9.7) (1.0,10.0) (1.1,10.4) (1.2,10.7) (1.3,11.2)
        };
        
        \legend{Back-to-Front, Outside-In, Hybrid}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Sensitivity of boarding strategies to varying luggage load factors}
    \label{fig:luggage_sensitivity}
\end{figure}

The sensitivity coefficient ($S_{\lambda}$), which quantifies the rate of change in boarding time with respect to luggage load, can be calculated as:

\begin{equation}
S_{\lambda} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \lambda} \cdot \frac{\lambda}{T}
\end{equation}

The calculated sensitivity coefficients are:
\begin{align*}
S_{\lambda,\text{Back-to-Front}} &= 0.87 \\
S_{\lambda,\text{Outside-In}} &= 0.80 \\
S_{\lambda,\text{Hybrid}} &= 0.71
\end{align*}

The lower sensitivity coefficient for the Hybrid strategy indicates greater robustness to variations in passenger luggage.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to Passenger Compliance}

We also analyzed the impact of varying passenger compliance rates ($\gamma$), where $\gamma = 1.0$ represents perfect compliance with boarding instructions, and lower values indicate proportionally reduced compliance. This is modeled by introducing a compliance factor into our differential equations:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_{ij}(t)}{dt} = -\gamma \cdot k_{ij} \cdot N_{ij}(t) \cdot I_{ij}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{ij}(t))
\end{equation}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Boarding Time (minutes) at Different Compliance Levels}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{$\gamma = 1.0$ (Perfect)} & \textbf{$\gamma = 0.9$ (Good)} & \textbf{$\gamma = 0.8$ (Moderate)} \\
\midrule
Back-to-Front & 12.0 & 13.3 & 15.0 \\
Outside-In & 10.0 & 11.1 & 12.5 \\
Hybrid & 10.0 & 10.8 & 11.9 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:compliance_sensitivity}
\end{table}

The compliance sensitivity coefficient ($S_{\gamma}$) is calculated similarly to the luggage sensitivity:

\begin{equation}
S_{\gamma} = \frac{\partial T}{\partial \gamma} \cdot \frac{\gamma}{T}
\end{equation}

The calculated values are:
\begin{align*}
S_{\gamma,\text{Back-to-Front}} &= -1.25 \\
S_{\gamma,\text{Outside-In}} &= -1.15 \\
S_{\gamma,\text{Hybrid}} &= -0.95
\end{align*}

The smaller absolute value for the Hybrid strategy indicates it is less sensitive to variations in passenger compliance, making it more robust in real-world scenarios.

\subsection{Mathematical Analysis of Interference Phenomena}

The superior performance of the Outside-In and Hybrid strategies can be explained by analyzing the mathematical properties of passenger interference. We define two types of interference:

1. \textbf{Row Interference ($I_R$)}: Occurs when passengers need to wait for others in front of them to clear the aisle.
2. \textbf{Seat Interference ($I_S$)}: Occurs when passengers need to wait for already-seated passengers to stand up to allow access to window or middle seats.

These interferences can be quantified as:

\begin{align}
I_R(t) &= \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=i+1}^{m} \frac{N_i(t) \cdot N_j(t)}{d_{ij}} \\
I_S(t) &= \sum_{j=1}^{3} \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \alpha_{jk} \cdot N_j(t) \cdot N_k(t)
\end{align}

Where $m$ is the number of zones, $d_{ij}$ is the distance between zones $i$ and $j$, and $\alpha_{jk}$ is the interference coefficient between seat types $j$ and $k$.

The Back-to-Front strategy minimizes $I_R$ but does nothing to address $I_S$. The Outside-In strategy eliminates $I_S$ but doesn't optimize for $I_R$. The Hybrid strategy balances both types of interference, achieving a global minimum of the combined interference function:

\begin{equation}
I_{\text{total}}(t) = w_R \cdot I_R(t) + w_S \cdot I_S(t)
\end{equation}

Where $w_R$ and $w_S$ are weighting factors determined to be approximately 0.4 and 0.6 respectively based on our simulation results.

\section{Real-World Implementation Considerations}

While our mathematical models demonstrate clear theoretical advantages for the Hybrid and Outside-In strategies, practical implementation requires consideration of additional factors:

\subsection{Passenger Compliance and Communication Framework}

The effectiveness of any boarding strategy depends on passenger compliance. Our model assumes perfect adherence to boarding instructions, which is rarely achieved in practice. We can account for this by introducing a compliance factor $\beta$ (where $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$) that scales the effectiveness of the boarding sequence:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_{ij}(t)}{dt} = -\beta \cdot k_{ij} \cdot N_{ij}(t) \cdot I_{ij}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{ij}(t))
\end{equation}

Based on empirical studies, $\beta$ typically ranges from 0.75 to 0.9 depending on communication clarity and passenger familiarity with the process.

The compliance factor $\beta$ can be modeled more precisely as a function of several variables:

\begin{equation}
\beta = \beta_0 \cdot (1 - \alpha_c \cdot C_{\text{complexity}} - \alpha_e \cdot C_{\text{experience}} - \alpha_i \cdot C_{\text{information}})
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta_0$ is the baseline compliance factor (typically 0.95)
    \item $C_{\text{complexity}}$ is the complexity factor of the boarding strategy
    \item $C_{\text{experience}}$ is the inexperience factor of the passenger population
    \item $C_{\text{information}}$ is the information deficit factor
    \item $\alpha_c$, $\alpha_e$, and $\alpha_i$ are weighting coefficients
\end{itemize}

These factors can be estimated empirically for each airport and airline operation.

\subsection{Group Travel Accommodation Models}

Our model assumes independent passengers, but in reality, many travelers are in groups that wish to board together. This can be addressed through a modified hybrid approach that maintains group integrity while preserving the key principles of our optimized strategy.

Let $G = \{g_1, g_2, ..., g_p\}$ be the set of passenger groups, where each group $g_k$ consists of passengers with potentially different seat types and zone assignments. We define the group assignment function $A(g_k)$ that determines when group $k$ should board:

\begin{equation}
A(g_k) = \min_{(i,j) \in g_k} \{P(i,j)\}
\end{equation}

Where $P(i,j)$ is the boarding priority of a passenger with zone $i$ and seat type $j$.

This ensures that groups board together at the earliest priority of any member, while still maintaining the overall structure of the hybrid strategy. The modified boarding dynamics equation becomes:

\begin{equation}
\frac{dN_{ij}(t)}{dt} = -k_{ij} \cdot N_{ij}(t) \cdot I_{ij}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{ij}(t)) \cdot G_{ij}(t)
\end{equation}

Where $G_{ij}(t)$ is an indicator function that is 1 when groups containing passengers with zone $i$ and seat type $j$ are being boarded, and 0 otherwise.

\subsection{Operational Implementation Complexity Analysis}

The complexity of implementing different strategies varies considerably, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:implementation_complexity}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Detailed Implementation Complexity Assessment}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Strategy} & \textbf{Operational Complexity} & \textbf{Passenger Confusion Potential} & \textbf{Implementation Cost Index} \\
\midrule
Back-to-Front & Low (0.3) & Low (0.2) & 0.25 \\
Outside-In & Medium (0.6) & Medium (0.5) & 0.55 \\
Hybrid & High (0.9) & High (0.8) & 0.85 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:implementation_complexity}
\end{table}

The Implementation Cost Index (ICI) is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\text{ICI} = w_{\text{op}} \cdot C_{\text{op}} + w_{\text{conf}} \cdot C_{\text{conf}}
\end{equation}

Where $C_{\text{op}}$ is the operational complexity score, $C_{\text{conf}}$ is the passenger confusion score, and $w_{\text{op}}$ and $w_{\text{conf}}$ are weighting factors (0.5 each).

While the Back-to-Front strategy may be easier to implement, its efficiency gains are more modest. The implementation complexity of our Hybrid strategy could be mitigated through clear communication, digital boarding passes with explicit group numbers, and consistent gate announcements.

\section{Conclusions and Future Research Directions}

\subsection{Key Findings}

This study has developed and analyzed mathematical models for aircraft boarding strategies using differential equations and fluid dynamics principles. Our findings confirm and extend previous research by providing a continuous model framework that offers both computational efficiency and theoretical insights. Specifically, we have:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Demonstrated that traditional Back-to-Front boarding methods are sub-optimal, offering modest improvements over random boarding.
    
    \item Confirmed the effectiveness of Outside-In (window-middle-aisle) boarding strategies, which reduce boarding times by approximately 33\% compared to random boarding.
    
    \item Proposed a novel Hybrid strategy that combines spatial and seat-type sequencing to maintain optimal boarding efficiency while enhancing consistency.
    
    \item Developed a mathematical framework using fluid dynamics and differential equations that allows for efficient analysis and optimization of boarding procedures.
    
    \item Provided rigorous statistical analysis demonstrating the superior consistency and robustness of the Hybrid strategy across various operational conditions.
\end{enumerate}

Our analysis shows that the proposed Hybrid strategy achieves optimal boarding times while demonstrating greater robustness to variations in passenger behavior and luggage load factors.

\subsection{Implications for Airlines}

The findings have significant implications for airline operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing optimized boarding strategies could reduce turnaround times by 3-5 minutes per flight.
    
    \item For a typical narrow-body aircraft completing 6-8 flights daily, this represents potential time savings of 18-40 minutes per aircraft per day.
    
    \item These time savings could be leveraged to either increase aircraft utilization (adding more flights) or improve on-time performance.
    
    \item Reduced turnaround times also translate to lower fuel consumption from idling aircraft and reduced airport congestion.
    
    \item The economic impact can be quantified using the formula:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Annual Savings} = N_{\text{flights}} \times \Delta T \times C_{\text{minute}} \times 365
    \end{equation}
    
    Where $N_{\text{flights}}$ is the number of daily flights, $\Delta T$ is the time saved per flight, and $C_{\text{minute}}$ is the cost per minute of aircraft operation (approximately \$30-50 for narrow-body aircraft).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}

Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The models assume idealized passenger behavior and perfect compliance with boarding instructions.
    
    \item Group travel dynamics are not fully incorporated into the current models.
    
    \item Our simulations do not account for irregular operations such as delays due to wheelchair assistance or late-arriving passengers.
    
    \item The models assume a specific aircraft configuration (Boeing 737-800) and would need adjustment for different aircraft types.
    
    \item The continuous flow approximation, while computationally efficient, may not capture all discrete behaviors that occur in real boarding scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Several promising avenues for future research emerge from this work:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Integration}: Developing adaptive boarding strategies that learn from historical boarding data and adjust in real-time to passenger behavior patterns. This could be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem with the state space defined by the current passenger distribution and the action space defined by different boarding group calls.
    
    \item \textbf{Group Dynamics Modeling}: Extending the mathematical framework to explicitly model family and group travel dynamics using clustered point processes and dependency structures:
    \begin{equation}
        P(X_i = x_i | X_j = x_j) = f(d_{ij}, r_{ij})
    \end{equation}
    Where $d_{ij}$ is the relationship degree and $r_{ij}$ is the seat proximity between passengers $i$ and $j$.
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Door Boarding}: Analyzing the efficiency gains possible through simultaneous front and rear door boarding for aircraft that support this capability. This would require modifying our differential equations to account for bi-directional flow:
    \begin{align}
        \frac{dN_{\text{front}}(t)}{dt} &= -k_{\text{front}} \cdot N_{\text{front}}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{\text{front}}(t)) \\
        \frac{dN_{\text{rear}}(t)}{dt} &= -k_{\text{rear}} \cdot N_{\text{rear}}(t) \cdot (1 - C_{\text{rear}}(t))
    \end{align}
    With additional coupling terms to account for interference between the two flows.
    
    \item \textbf{Stochastic Models}: Incorporating probabilistic elements to better represent the inherent variability in passenger behavior and processing times through stochastic differential equations:
    \begin{equation}
        dN(t) = -k \cdot N(t) \cdot (1 - C(t)) \, dt + \sigma \cdot N(t) \, dW_t
    \end{equation}
    Where $W_t$ is a Wiener process and $\sigma$ is the volatility parameter.
    
    \item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Conducting real-world trials to validate and refine the theoretical models presented in this study, with particular attention to quantifying the distribution of passenger behavior parameters.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, our mathematical modeling approach provides a robust framework for understanding and optimizing aircraft boarding procedures. By treating passenger flow as a continuous fluid system governed by differential equations, we gain both computational efficiency and theoretical insights that can lead to significant improvements in airline operations. The statistical analyses further demonstrate that the Hybrid strategy not only matches the Outside-In strategy in terms of mean boarding time but also provides significantly greater consistency and robustness to operational variations.

    \State $times \gets$ empty array of length $n\_simulations$
    \For{$i = 1$ to $n\_simulations$}

\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The Monte Carlo simulation procedure was used to generate the statistical results presented in Section 6. For each strategy, we ran 50 simulations with parameters randomly sampled from their respective distributions:

\begin{align}
k_{ij} &\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{k}, \sigma_{k}^2) \\
\lambda &\sim \mathcal{N}(1.0, 0.1^2) \\
\gamma &\sim \mathcal{N}(0.9, 0.05^2)
\end{align}

Where $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ represents a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
